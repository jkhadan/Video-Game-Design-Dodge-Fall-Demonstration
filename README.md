# Dodgefall Unity Demonstration

This project outlines the various aspects of Unity that went into creating this simple 2D game in which you are tasked with avoiding incoming objects. Hopefully the team can use this project as practice before diving into our final project.


## Goals
There are three main goals that are hoped to be accomplished with this project:
- The teams can learn how to work with Unity, Github and eachother
- Everybody on the team is able to get a sense for what division they want to be in and how they best see fit contributing to the project based on skill level and comfortability
- We are able to assess the best way for the divisions to cohere (i.e. Slack, Trello, etc.)
- We figure out what we would need in order to get up and running (i.e. Adobe Illustrator)

# Development Team
The development team will be responsible for writing the code, arranging the objects and configuring such things as the build settings. Additionally, the team will be responsible for commiting changes and translating the work of other teams into the game.

## Required Knowledge & Resources
- Unity
- Github
- C#

### Conventions

In order for the team to be more streamline, organized and consistent we must adhere and maintain a certain standard when it comes to writing our code.

I suggest adding comments to lines on your code in order to explain what you are doing along the way

# Design Team
The design team will mainly focus on piecing the game together in order for it to look coherent and not sloppy. The team will work on aspects such as the GUI, the menus, the types of characters needed, the backgrounds and other aspects that make up the atmosphere of the game.

We would need a mediator from the design team to translate these designs into our game using Unity.

# Art Team
The art team will focus on creating the visuals for the game such as the character art, drawing the backgrounds, etc. We would need a way for the team to translate their art into the game. For this we would need another mediator. We also need the team to produce their work in a format that is most beneficial to the game, which would be most beneficial in a [sprite map](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker/tutorials/how-to-create-a-sprite-sheet)

## Suggested Resources
